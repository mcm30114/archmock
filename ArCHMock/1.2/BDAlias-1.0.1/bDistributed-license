Note: This is the license for all of the above software. The archives above contain the license that specifically applies to each individual component; however, they are all substantially similar to the below. Since bDistributed.com, Inc. is defunct, the current copyright holder is myself, Christopher M. Hanson, which is reflected in the below license but not in the included licenses in the archives; this is because the archives are unchanged since they were first posted.
